# Wealthbot: Autonomous Trading dApp on Solana

## Objective
Wealthbot aims to help users grow their equity autonomously by trading SOL perpetuals on the Drift Protocol within the Solana blockchain. The app uses agent-driven operations inspired by hedge fund strategies, targeting long-term compounded growth with a goal of reaching $1,000,000 in equity over 3-5 years.

## "Set It and Forget It" Philosophy
Wealthbot is designed for complete automation with minimal user intervention:
1. Connect your Phantom wallet (minimum $125 SOL balance for gas fees)
2. Deposit minimum $100 SOL to start trading
3. Click "Start" and let the autonomous system handle everything
4. Optionally deposit more funds anytime to accelerate growth
5. Monitor your progress through the dashboard

## Core Features

### 1. User Access
- Simple One-Click Start: Connect wallet, deposit, and click start

- Minimum Requirements:
  - $125 SOL in Phantom wallet (includes buffer for gas fees)
  - $100 SOL minimum initial deposit for trading
  - Additional deposits accepted anytime to accelerate growth

### 2. Autonomous Trading Engine
The system employs multiple specialized agents working in concert:

- **Trading Agent**: Executes SOL perpetual trades on Drift Protocol
- **Risk Management Agent**: Uses machine learning to dynamically manage risk exposure
- **Strategy Agent**: Optimizes trading strategies using real-time data for compounded growth
- **Research Agent**: Tracks SOL and Drift Protocol trends for strategy adjustments
- **Backtesting Agent**: Validates strategies with historical data

### 3. User Dashboard
